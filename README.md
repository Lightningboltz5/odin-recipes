# odin-recipes
Odin project exercise repo
In this repository I'll review all my recently acquired HTML skills
and put the to the test by making a simple recipe page

I'll also list on this README file all the previous skills mantioned
on the foundations part of the odin project course:

*Installing a new OS such as xubuntu in a VirtualMachine, making
a good practice of familiarizing to VM's and differents OS.

*Getting around xubuntu using only the Terminal by using commands such as
mkdir, ls, -f, cd, cd.. , touch/echo, code and such, and installing
programs such as Google Chrome.

*Get an introductory notion of Git, how it works and why it is important
for every developer, by making snapshots of your code so you can rollback
if anything breaks later on, it is a good practice to commit your code on
Git often so you make the habit of it and have several points to return to
in case the situation arise.

*Setting up my GitHub account, generating a SSH key, which allows me to link
my local machine to github and push my code directly to my profile, and learn
some basic command such as git commit,git push,git  clone, and how they work
making the "stage" analogy with commit as the waiting room, and push as 
uploading it.

*Learning the basics of internet and networks, the definitions of a client and
server, how information is breaked down into packets so you can get your
inquiry in a more efficient way.

*Learning the basics of HTML by making boilerplates by hand to make good 
muscle memory for the future. Naming root directories as Index.html 
 commands such as DOCTYPE, !, title, meta,
head, body, p, h1-6, ul, ol, a, href, src, alt, and such.

*And finally i'm going to make a simple recipe page by putting all of 
this knowledge to the test.
