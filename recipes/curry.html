 <h2>Ingredients</h2>
 <ul>
   <li>3 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1 inch cubes.</li>
   <li>6 cloves of garlic.</li>
   <li>1 (1 inch) piece of fresh ginger root-peeled, sliced and crushed.</li>
   <li> 3Â½ tablespoons white vinegar. </li>
   <li> 2 teaspoons of salt.</li>
   <li>1 tablespoon curry powder, toasted.</li>
   <li> 1 tablespoon ground black pepper.</li>
   <li> 2 tablespoons of cayenne pepper.</li>
   <li>3 tablespoons of vegetable oil.</li>
   <li>8 fresh curry leaves.</li>
   <li>4 strips pandan leaf.</li>
   <li>2 whole cloves.</li>
   <li>2 tablespoons of tomato paste.</li>
   <li>1 cup of water.</li>
   <li>1 cup of thick coconut milk</li>
    </ul>

 <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
<li>
    Rinse the beef and pat dry. Crush the garlic cloves into a paste 
    and combine it with the crushed ginger. Add the vinegar, salt, 
    pepper, roasted curry powder, and cayenne. Mix in the beef cubes 
    and toss to coat. Set aside for 30 minutes.
</li>
 <li>Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the curry leaves 
    and pandan strips. Stir in the onions. Cook, stirring frequently, 
    until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
 </li>
 <li>
    Mix in the beef cubes and cook until browned on all sides, about 10 
    minutes. Stir in the cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, and cloves. Add 
    the tomato paste and water and mix well.</li>
 <li>
    Simmer, covered, on low heat for 1 1/2 hours or until the meat is tender. 
    Check the curry every half hour; you may need to add more water (up to 
    1 cup) if the curry is too dry and is sticking to the pan.
 </li>
 <li>
    Add the coconut milk and heat through. Taste and adjust the seasonings 
    before serving.</li>
